This is a README file for an ITEC325 group project concerning the creation of a webpage named "Elites" in hopes of adpotion into the college of Computer Science and Technology (CSAT) as a common resource tool for students and teachers. This program will provide a away to push for an advancement in skills such as leadership and professionalism through participation and reflection of science, math, and IT students.One goal for this project is to allow for points or badges to be colleted and then used to recognize students durring the graduation ceremony by the Dean of CSAT. This project is currently in the analysis and requirments phase of the SLDC. 

Below is a set of predefined requirements and brief description provided by ibarland(GitHub user tag):
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Task: Set up a site where students can self-report their qualifying 
work in each of four different categories.  Compute a total score [sum of each category,
subject to a cap].

Individual students can see their own history, and an administrator can see each student's info,
as well as a summary page listing everybody's summary.

A student can request that a blurb is e-mailed to ANY prof, who clicks on a link, which is then
added to the database.

An administrator can tag self-reported items as "accepted", "rejected" (else "pending").

Administrator can also enter other items (e.g. gpa-in-major, a helpfulness-rating, etc),
and a weighted-average is also there.

Perhaps also have a public-viewable page, showing selected tasks (by an admin) anonymously.

Allow for a reflective piece, where students write short snippets about how the program
has helped them (or what would have worked better for them).

Goal: make this better than a google-doc/survey would be!

Have a way to connect this to a LinkedIn account ?
