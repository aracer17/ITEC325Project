This is a README file for an ITEC325 group project concerning the creation of a webpage in hopes of adpotion into the college of Computer Science and Technology (CSAT) as a common resource tool for students and teachers. This project is currently in the analysis and requirments phase of the SLDC. 

Below is a set of predefined requirements and brief description provided by ibarland(GitHub user tag):

The "Elites" program is a way of encouraging leadership and professional activities 
in science/math/technology students.  If a student in the program accrues enough points,
they are recognized at graduation by the Dean of the College of Science and Technology.


Task: Set up a site where students can self-report their qualifying 
work in each of four different categories.  Compute a total score [sum of each category,
subject to a cap].

Individual students can see their own history, and an administrator can see each student's info,
as well as a summary page listing everybody's summary.

A student can request that a blurb is e-mailed to ANY prof, who clicks on a link, which is then
  added to the database.

An administrator can tag self-reported items as "accepted", "rejected" (else "pending").

Administrator can also enter other items (e.g. gpa-in-major, a helpfulness-rating, etc),
  and a weighted-average is also there.

Perhaps also have a public-viewable page, showing selected tasks (by an admin) anonymously.

Allow for a reflective piece, where students write short snippets about how the program
  has helped them (or what would have worked better for them).

  Goal: make this better than a google-doc/survey would be!

Have a way to connect this to a LinkedIn account ?
